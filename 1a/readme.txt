Here, we have generated an output that compares the greatest and lowest glucose readings.
For each case, we have plotted the population mean as well as the sample mean.

Comparison of Mean Glucose: 
The sample mean bar is less than the population mean bar, indicating that the sample's average glucose levels are lower than those of the population as a whole.

Compare the Highest Glucose Value
Two bars should be included in the bar chart showing the highest glucose values: one for the highest value in the sample and another for the highest value in the population.
Given that the sample's greatest value bar is smaller than the population's highest value bar, it may be inferred that the sample's highest glucose level was lower than the population's highest level overall.

Interpretation: Lower sample mean: A portion of the people in the sample had lower blood glucose levels.
Maximum value of the lower sample: The sample's highest glucose value is less than the population's highest value.
